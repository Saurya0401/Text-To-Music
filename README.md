# Text-To-Music
A simple Python program that plays a random chord progression when a text phrase is provided as an input.

The program is GUI based and plays a chord progression in which the number of chords is equivalent to the number of characters provided in the input. There are 24 distinct progressions, starting with every note from A - G#m, and one is randomly selected when the main() function in TextToMusic.py is run.
